# PyBer_Analysis_Overview:

The purpose of the project was to analyze data for a ridesharing company called PyBer and our goal is  to create a summary dataframe that will show ride sharing data by city type(Rural,Urban & Suburban). The dataframe is later convertored to create a visualizations of the rideshare data to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

# Results:

Based on the results we see that Urban cities have the most amount of rides and drivers and Rural cities have the least. However,  the Average Fare Per Ride is higher in the Rural cities than the 
Urban cities therefore, there is a nverse relationship for average fare per ride and average fare per driver.
However, for Average Fare per Ride column  we can see that Rural city types have the highest average fare per ride, meaning more revenue in this city type for every ride increase compared to Urban city types wich has the lowest average fare per ride.

Looking at the graph the Urban city types had the highest total fares for all the weeks and rural areas had the least. We can also can concluded that the 3rd week of February has the highest total fares for each of the city type indicating there is an increased for rides during that time. Urban cities have a lot of revenue in the first and third week of March. Towards the start of January 2019 and towards the end of April all Fares for each city type are showling decline.
# Summary:

My recommendations to Pyber are:
1)The Urban city with having the highest fare they need to focus on providing services that is  affordability and short wait times based on driver availability. This will help them be more appealing then other means of transportation.

2)For the Rural city with having a Average Fare Per Ride and Average Fare Per Drivers. The recommendation is that more marketing should be done to increase the amount of drives especially when there may be limtited transportation in that city type. 

3)For the suburban city type who are avgerage for making money, there is alot of room for improvement. There needs to be more investment in social media marketing during the March-April becasue we see a drop in rides. Maybe create a promotion the for thoughs that may take a green approach, by having bike racks or promotion more car pooling.
